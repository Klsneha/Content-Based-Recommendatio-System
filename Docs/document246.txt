Wikibooks:Welcome From Wikibooks, open books for an open world Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikibooks is a Wikimedia project for collaboratively writing open-content textbooks that anyone, including you, can edit right now by clicking on the edit link that appears near the top of each Wikibooks page. Wikibooks has two sub-projects; Wikijunior which is aimed at children and the Cookbook which is our collection of recipes and culinary topics. Contributors maintain the property rights to their contributions, while the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License and the GNU Free Documentation License makes sure that the submitted version and its derivative works will always remain freely distributable and reproducible. See Wikibooks:Copyrights for more information. Wikibooks went online on 10 July 2003. Feel free to browse around our growing number of steadily improving books and be sure to check out our collection of featured books. Wikibooks is very much a community effort, so feel free to improve and add to the existing content, start a new book, and join project-related discussions in the Wikibooks reading rooms.

Help Category:Subject:Java programming language From Wikibooks, open books for an open world Jump to navigation Jump to search < Computer programming languagespurge this page's server cache Java programming language Books in this subject area deal with the Java programming language: a programming language released as a core component of Oracle's Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
